# Nwinkler Random Color Theme

## Description

The _Nwinkler Random Color_ Theme is based on the
[`nwinkler theme`](HTTPS://GitHub.Com/Bash-it/bash-it/wiki/Themes#nwinkler), but
it randomizes the colors for:

-   time
-   username
-   hostname
-   path

The random colors are chosen the first time this theme is used and saved to the
`~/.nwinkler_random_colors` file. So, the next time you connect to the same
machine, you will get the same colors.

To force new random colors to be selected, run the command:

```sh
randomize_nwinkler
```

## Usage Scenario

This theme is especially useful when connecting to many different machines and
switching between them often. Yes, the hostname _is_ present in the prompt. But
I argue that it's a lot faster to get a "feel" of what machine you are currently
on because of the custom colors on that machine's prompt than by reading the
hostname.
